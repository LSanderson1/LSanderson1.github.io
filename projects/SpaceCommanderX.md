Space Commander X is a game developed on Unity where you control a ship in which you are to use to defeat oncoming forces. 
Basic controls are used, WASD for example along with support for arrow keys as well.
The game is never-ending, meaning that it will not stop until you as the player is defeated.
```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
